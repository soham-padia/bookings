# Trial webapp

This is my attemp to make a trial website with the help of [this course on udemy](https://www.udemy.com/course/building-modern-web-applications-with-go/) 

- built in Go version 1.16
- Uses the [chi router](github.com/go-chi/chi/)
- Uses the [alex edwards SCS session management](github.com/alexedwards/scs)
- Uses [nosurf](github.com/justinas/nosurf)
